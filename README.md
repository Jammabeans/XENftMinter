# Bulk XENft Minter Tool

This Python program allows you to send transactions on the Ethereum network, specifically calling the `bulkClaimRank` function on a smart contract. The program uses a graphical user interface built with Tkinter, making it easy for users to input the required information and monitor the status of their transactions.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the XenftMinterBot, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Web3.py library: Install it by running `pip install web3` in your command prompt or terminal.

## Running the program

To run the XenftMinterBot, follow these steps for your specific platform:

### Windows

1. Save the provided Python code as a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `XenftMinterBot.py`.
2. Open a Command Prompt in the same directory as the saved Python file.
3. Run the following command: `python XenftMinterBot.py`.

### macOS and Linux

1. Save the provided Python code as a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `XenftMinterBot.py`.
2. Open a Terminal in the same directory as the saved Python file.
3. Run the following command: `python3 XenftMinterBot.py`.

## Usage

1. Input your Ethereum private key in the "Private Key" field.
2. Input your Ethereum node URL in the "Ethereum Node URL" field.
3. Input the contract address in the "Contract Address" field.
4. Input the desired values for "VUMs per XENft", "Number of Days", "Max Gas Price (Gwei)", "Number of XENft's", and "Chain ID".

The status label at the bottom of the window will update as transactions are sent and confirmed.

**Note:** Make sure to keep your private key secure and never share it with anyone.
